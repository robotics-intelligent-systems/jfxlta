A hybrid airship is a powered aircraft that obtains some of its lift as a lighter-than-air airship and some from aerodynamic lift as a heavier-than-air aerodyne. Nuclear batteries have a wide range of applications due to their long lifespan and energy density. A high-altitude platform station (HAPS, which can also mean high-altitude pseudo-satellite or high-altitude platform systems), also known as atmospheric satellite, is a long endurance, high altitude aircraft able to offer observation or communication services similarly to artificial satellites.
