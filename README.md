AutonomySim is a high-fidelity, photorealistic simulator for multi-agent and -domain autonomous systems, intelligent robotic systems, or embodiment as it is known in the AI research community. Nuclear batteries have a wide range of applications due to their long lifespan and energy density. RCE is a distributed, workflow-based integration environment. Engineers and scientists use it to design and simulate complex systems (e.g., aircraft, ships, or satellites) by integrating their own design and simulation tools.
